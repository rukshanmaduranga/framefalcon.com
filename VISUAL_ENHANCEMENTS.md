## 🌟 Why No External Images?

Instead of using external images (which can slow down your site), I've created:

1. **CSS-Based Visuals**
   - Faster loading times
   - Always crisp (vector-based)
   - Easy to customize colors
   - No broken image links

2. **Icon Emojis**
   - Universal support
   - Colorful and recognizable
   - No additional files needed
   - Perfect for placeholders

3. **Gradient Backgrounds**
   - Professional look
   - Brand-color aligned
   - Smooth animations
   - Modern aesthetic
